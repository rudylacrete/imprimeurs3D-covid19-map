## Why Gatsby

The first answer is why not? My goal was to discover this framework as we can hear about it everywhere. The application I wanted to build was the perfect match because I didn't need to use a backend thanks to Google Firebase API.
I ran into a lot of headache to manage a correct production build but the game was worthing the cost. This tool is amazing. The learning curve is anyway quite tougher and dealing with some React tricks didn't made the game easier. But my conclusion is that Gatsby is a very amazing tool and not so difficult to use after all.
